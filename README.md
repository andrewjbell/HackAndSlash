HackAndSlash
============
Hack and Slash is a traditional rogue-like game.  It is written in C# and uses the libtcod library to make working
in the console a bit easier.  The goal of the game is to get to the dungeon level 10.  In-game help provides the
key mappings and controls.

This is the final version for class.  There are a few bugs that I am aware of but have not been able to correct
at this point.  The game is playable for the most part.  One issue that can occur is with the map generation.
There are times when it is not possible to get to a down staircase because the map has placed a wall in the way,
but this does not happen that often.  The health display is not working as it should all of the time, but does
work sometimes.
